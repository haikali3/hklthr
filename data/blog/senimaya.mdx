## Introduction

i thought the hardest part of building senimaya.com would be the engineering. turns out, the hardest part is money. getting users to pay is a whole different game compared to getting the tech to work.

this post is about what i built, what i learned, and the challenge of turning a working product into a business.

## 1. Engineering Phase

as an engineer, i was excited.

- got image generation working by ready to use inference provider(fal.ai, openrouter.ai)
- built a credit system to control cost, starting price $7
- added an ai gallery to showcase results
- only cost $10 for the domain but image gen start to get expensive the more image is produce

from a technical perspective, senimaya.com worked. i had a running product, fast outputs, and features people could use.

## 2. Product Phase

this is where reality hit.

- i got some early visitors, but very few signups
- users left comments like: _“why should i use this instead of ChatGPT? GPT is free, yours i need to pay”_
- i realized “working” isn’t the same as “valuable”
- most people didn’t care about infra speed or credit systems — they wanted clear reasons to pay

engineering gave me a product. product work made me face the market.

## 3. Key Learnings

- **free vs paid**: competing with free tools (like ChatGPT) means you need _super clear differentiation_
- **attention ≠ adoption**: comments and feedback don’t always convert to paying users
- **engineering joy vs market reality**: what feels like a breakthrough in code can feel invisible to users
- **value story matters more than features**
- **analytics matter**: i learned to use tools like [posthog.com](https://posthog.com) to understand how users interact with the site
- **feedback loops**: i set up a place for users to give feedback and suggest features at [senimaya.canny.io](https://senimaya.canny.io)

## 4. Challenges

### as an engineer

- easy to spend weeks improving infra no one notices
- building features no one asked for because they were “fun”
- shipping doesn’t equal revenue

### as a product builder

- convincing users why this exists when “ChatGPT is already free”
- translating vague feedback (“make it better”) into actionable changes
- the loneliness of no traction despite weeks of building

## 5. Future Improvements

- double down on use cases GPT doesn’t solve well (product photography, fashion try-on, interior design)
- show side-by-side comparisons: “here’s what GPT makes vs here’s what Senimaya makes”
- add free tier or trial to reduce friction for first-time users
- focus marketing on niches that _need_ visuals, not general users

## 6. Conclusion

engineering senimaya.com was hard but doable. monetizing it is another beast. the gap between a product that works and a product people pay for is wide.

the biggest lesson so far: building is only half the journey. the real challenge is convincing strangers that what you built is worth their money.
