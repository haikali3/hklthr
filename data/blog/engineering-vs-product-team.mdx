## Introduction

i've been both in engineering team and product team.  
always loved building things, solving problems, and shipping code.  
then came the inevitable question: "should i move to product?"  
this doc covers my journey, the challenges, and what i learned along the way.

## 1. The Crossroads

i started noticing a pattern after being in both engineering and product team.  
**stay in engineering team** or **move to product team**?  
both paths seemed valid, but very different.

found out it's not just about code anymore.  
it's about people, processes, and product strategy.

## 2. Engineering Team Life

### what i loved

- **building microcomponents** for products with different designs and features
- looking at senior developers work on building the **Form Rendering Engine (FERE)** which auto-generates multi-step forms from a form schema, without requiring developers to handle design, styling, and form logic
- creating **micro components** for product teams
- the satisfaction of **navigating around design system built by designers**

### what i struggled with

- **managing feature requests** from product teams
- **communicating technical limitations** to product teams
- **maintaining** components used by multiple products

## 3. Product Team Life

### what i loved

- **building insurance products** using microcomponents built by engineering team (awesome microcomponents and easy to use)
- **leveraging FERE** for form creation
- **understanding customer needs** for insurance products
- **managing dependencies** on engineering team's capacity

### what i struggled with

- **limited FERE documentation** forcing frequent senior dev consultations
- **dependency on senior devs** just to request FERE features
- **fixing broken components** built by others when engineering team is busy

## 4. The Microcomponent Architecture

### the system

- **engineering team** builds core microcomponents
- **senior engineers** maintain the Form Rendering Engine
- **product team** assembles insurance products
- **reusable components** speed up development

### the challenges

- **capacity constraints** in engineering team
- **feature requests** piling up
- **timeline mismatches** between teams
- **technical debt** vs new features

## 5. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### The Good

#### Product Team

- **business mindset** becomes second nature
- **customer-focused** thinking
- **stable tech stack** - no need to chase latest trends
- **clear impact** on business metrics
- **predictable work** with established patterns

#### Engineering Team

- **exciting technical challenges**
- **opportunity to innovate**
- **fast-paced environment**
- **solving complex problems**
- **building foundational systems**

### The Bad

#### Product Team

- **can feel boring** compared to engineering
- **limited technical growth**
- **repetitive work** with similar patterns
- **dependency** on engineering team's capacity
- **less hands-on** with new technologies

#### Engineering Team

- **constant pressure** to keep up with trends
- **high expectations** for innovation
- **complex problem-solving** every day
- **need to maintain** systems
- **balancing** new features vs technical debt

### The Ugly

#### Product Team

- **frustration** in doing the same thing over and over again
- **business pressure** vs technical reality
- **misalignment** with engineering priorities
- **slow progress** for career growth

#### Engineering Team

- **senior engineers leaving** when vision misaligns
- **abandoned innovations** without maintenance
- **documentation gaps** when experts leave
- **technical debt** from rushed features
- **burnout** from constant innovation pressure
- **systems** becoming unmaintainable
- **knowledge silos** when experts depart

## 6. Future Plans

- **improve** capacity planning process
- **enhance** component documentation
- **streamline** feature request workflow
- **build better** communication channels
- **create** clearer prioritization framework
- **develop** better estimation methods
- **establish** better knowledge sharing
- **plan** for technical succession

the journey continues.  
maybe the best path isn't choosing one or the other.  
maybe it's about finding ways to make both teams work better together.
