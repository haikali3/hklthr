## Introduction

Spent a year at Etiqa building UI components in React. Used Storybook as our playground and chose CSS-in-TS over Tailwind. Here's what worked, what sucked, and what we learned from open-source giants like shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and Mantine.

## Tech Stack

- **React + Storybook** for all UI work
- **CSS-in-TS** using `styled-components` / `vanilla-extract` (depends on context)
- **No Tailwind** — here’s why ↓

## Why CSS-in-TS Instead of Tailwind?

### Reasons We Chose It

- Props + styles in the same file = better co-location
- Dynamic styling (based on props/state) was easier
- Theme-aware design tokens integrated well (colors, spacing, breakpoints)
- Better control over specificity vs utility classes

### What Inspired Us

- Looked at how **shadcn/ui**, **Radix**, and **Mantine** structured components
- Noticed most of them abstracted styling logic cleanly
- Wanted similar control + flexibility
- Didn’t want to fight Tailwind on edge cases

### Example

```tsx
// button.tsx
export const Button = styled.button(({ variant, theme }) => ({
  backgroundColor: variant === 'primary' ? theme.colors.blue : theme.colors.gray,
  padding: theme.spacing.md,
  borderRadius: theme.radius.sm,
}))
```

vs

```tsx
// tailwind version
<button className="rounded bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2" />
```

## Pain Points

### High Maintenance Cost

- Every style change = component rebuild + Storybook test + app re-check
- Theming logic sometimes too abstract
- Onboarding new devs took longer without Tailwind familiarity

### Design-Token Drift

- Needed good sync between design tokens and component logic
- If design team changed a spacing or color token, had to update in multiple places

### Scaling Problems

- Every new component added more surface area to maintain
- Needed strict PR reviews to avoid styling hacks creeping in

## Takeaways

### What We’d Do Again

- Co-located styles and logic helped long term
- Storybook was essential — helped catch bugs early
- CSS-in-TS gave us full control over themes + props

### What We’d Reconsider

- Tailwind + shadcn might be a better middle ground now
- Less setup, better DX, more community support
- CSS-in-TS shines when you need deep control — but that comes with a price

## Conclusion

Building a component library looks simple on the surface.

But once you go past buttons and modals, it gets complex fast — theming, tokens, docs, consistency, accessibility, etc.

Our CSS-in-TS setup worked for us at Etiqa, but wouldn't recommend it blindly. Evaluate your needs, your team, and your appetite for long-term maintenance.
