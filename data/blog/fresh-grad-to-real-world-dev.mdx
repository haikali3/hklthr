summary: 'Fresh out of uni, I thought being a good dev meant knowing syntax and shipping fast. A year in the real world changed that. Here’s how my thinking evolved — from rushing to reflecting.'

## Introduction

when i graduated, i thought i was ready.  
turns out, i just knew how to code — not how to solve real problems.  
my first year working at etiqa rewired the way i think.  
it wasn't about learning new tools. it was about learning how to think differently.

## Fresh Grad Me

- thought fast = smart
- avoided things i didn’t understand
- do not know whats going on
- googled a solution, copy-pasted, moved on
- didn’t take ownership

## Work Taught Me This

### Slower Is Faster

rushing always led to rework.  
i learned to pause. write things down. sketch the flow.  
most bugs weren’t hard, they were hidden by messy thinking.

### Understand Human Behavior

coding is one thing, but working with people is another.  
i learned to observe, listen, and understand how others think.  
it’s not just about writing code, it’s about solving problems together.

### Argue with Solid Arguments

early on, i’d avoid debates or rely on opinions.  
now, i back my points with data, examples, and logic.  
a strong argument, it’s about being clear and reasonable.

### Don’t Panic, Trace

early on, i’d freak out when something broke.  
now? i zoom out. read logs. trace what changed.

### Ask Better Questions

before: “why doesn’t this work?”  
now: “what do i _expect_ to happen, and what actually _is_ happening?”  
better questions = faster answers.  
debugging is more about logic than luck.

### You vs You

comparison used to kill me.  
seeing senior devs do things in 5 mins made me feel behind.  
but i realized i’m not racing them.  
just need to be better than yesterday.

## Conclusion

i came in trying to prove i was good enough.  
i left year one learning to _become_ good enough.  
still a long way to go.  
but now, i’m more patient. more curious. less afraid to be wrong.  
and that’s progress.
